# AdLibido - WebAudio plugin of AdPlug

This is a JavaScript/WebAudio version of AdPlug. This plugin is designed to work with my 
generic WebAudio ScriptProcessor music player (see separate project). 

An online demo of the emulator can be accessed using: https://www.wothke.ch/AdLibido/

The project structure still reflects the one of the used 'adplug-2.2.1' (except for necessary 
bug fixes the original code is unchanged). Everything specific to the WebAudio port can be 
found in the added 'emscripten' sub-folder (see respective sub-folder for more details).
